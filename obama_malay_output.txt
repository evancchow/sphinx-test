Transcription: well good afternoon selamat petang please everybody have a seat it is wonderful to be here and it is wonderful to see all these outstanding young people here i want to thank first of all the university of malaya for hosting us i want to thank the malaysian people for making us feel so welcome anita thank you for helping to moderate these trips are usually all business for me but every once in a while i want to have some fun so i try to hold an event like this where i get to hear directly from young people like you because i firmly believe that you will shape the future of your countries and the future of this region and im glad to see so many students who are here today including young people from across southeast asia and i know some of you are joining us online and through social media and youll be able to ask me questions too this is my fifth trip to asia as president and i plan to be back again later this year not just because i like the sights and the food although i do but because a few years ago i made a deliberate and strategic decision as president of the united states that america will play a larger more comprehensive role in this regions future i know some still ask what this strategy is all about so before i answer your questions i just want to answer that one question why asia is so important to america and why southeast asia has been a particular focus and finally why i believe that young people like you have to be the ones who lead us forward many of you know this part of the world has special meaning for me i was born in hawaii right in the middle of the pacific i lived in indonesia as a boy applause hey theres the indonesian contingent applause yes thats where theyre from my sister maya was born in jakarta shes married to a man whose parents were born here my brotherinlaws father in sandakan and his mom in kudat applause and my mother spent years working in the villages of southeast asia helping women buy sewing machines or gain an education so that they could better earn a living and as i mentioned last night to his majesty the king and the prime minister im very grateful for the islamic arts museum malaysia for hosting an exhibit that showcased some of my mothers batik collection because it meant a lot to her and its part of the connection that i felt and i continue to feel to this region so the asia pacific with its rich cultures and beautiful traditions and vibrant society thats all part of who i am it helped shape how i see the world and its also helped to shape my approach as president and while our government our financial centers many of our traditions began along the atlantic coast america has always been a pacific nation as well our biggest most populous state is on the pacific coast and for generations waves of immigrants from all over asia from different countries and races and religions have come to america and contributed to our success from our earliest years when our first president george washington sent a trade mission to china through last year when the aircraft carrier that bears his name the george washington helped with typhoon relief in the philippines america has always had a history with asia and weve got a future with asia this is the worlds fastestgrowing region over the next five years nearly half of all economic growth outside the united states is projected to come from right here in asia that means this region is vital to creating jobs and opportunity not only for yourselves but also for the american people and any serious leader in america recognizes that fact and because youre home to more than half of humanity asia will largely define the contours of the century ahead whether its going to be marked by conflict or cooperation by human suffering or human progress this is why america has refocused our attention on the vast potential of the asia pacific region my country has come through a decade in which we fought two wars and an economic crisis that hurt us badly along with countries all over the globe but weve now ended the war in iraq our war in afghanistan will end this year our businesses are steadily creating new jobs and weve begun addressing the challenges that have weighed down our economy for too long reforming our health care and financial systems raising standards in our schools building a clean energy economy cutting our fiscal deficits by more than half since i took office though weve been busy at home the crisis still confronts us in other parts of the world from the middle east to ukraine but i want to be very clear let me be clear about this because some people have wondered whether because of what happens in ukraine or what happens in the middle east whether this will sideline our strategy it has not we are focused and were going to follow through on our interest in promoting a strong usasia relationship america has responsibilities all around the world and were glad to embrace those responsibilities and yes sometimes we have a political system of our own and it can be easy to lose sight of the long view but we have been moving forward on our rebalance to this part of the world by opening ties of commerce and negotiating our most ambitious trade agreement by increasing our defense and educational exchange cooperation and modernizing our alliances by participating fully in regional institutions like the east asia summit building deeper partnerships with emerging powers like indonesia and vietnam and increasingly were building these partnerships throughout southeast asia since president johnsons visit here to malaysia in 1966 theres perhaps no region on earth that has changed so dramatically old dictatorships have crumbled new voices have emerged controlled economies have given way to free markets what used to be small villages kampungs are now gleaming skyscrapers the nations that make up asean are home to nearly one in of the worlds citizens and when you put those countries together youre the seventh largest economy in the world the fourth largest market for american exports the numberone destination for american investment in asia and im proud to be the first american president to meet regularly with all asean leaders and i intend to do it every year that i remain president applause by the way i want to congratulate malaysia on its turn to assume the chairmanship of asean next year applause malaysia plays a central role in this region that will only keep growing over time with an ability to promote economic growth and opportunity and be an anchor of stability and maritime security now one of the things that makes this region so interesting is its diversity that diversity creates a unique intersection of humanity people from so many ethnic groups and backgrounds and religious and political beliefs it gives malaysia as one primary example the chance to prove as america constantly tries to prove that nations are stronger and more successful when they work to uphold the civil rights and political rights and human rights of all their citizens applause thats why over the past few years prime minister najib and i have worked to broaden and deepen the relationship between our two countries in the same spirit of berkerja sama that i think so many of you embody applause the united states remains the numberone investor in malaysia were partnering to promote security in shipping lanes were making progress on the transpacific partnership to boost trade that supports good jobs and prosperity in both our countries today im very pleased that weve forged a comprehensive partnership that lays the foundation for even closer cooperation for years to come but our strategy is more than just security alliances or trade agreements its also about building genuine relationships between the peoples of asia and the peoples of the united states especially young people we want you to be getting to know the young people of the united states and partnering well into the future in science and technology and entrepreneurship and education one program that were proud of here in malaysia is the fulbright english teaching assistant program applause hey there we go laughter over the past two years nearly americans have come here and they havent just taught english theyve made lifelong friendships with their students and their communities one of these americans im told was a young woman named kelsey from a city in boston the city of boston last year after the boston marathon was attacked she taught her students all about her hometown its history and its culture she taught them a phrase thats popular in boston wicked awesome so that was part of the english curriculum laughter and so her students began to feel like a place that this place boston that was a world away was actually something they understood and they connected to and they cared about they responded by writing getwell cards and sending them to hospitals where many of the victims were being treated partnerships like those remind us that the relationship between nations is not just defined by governments but is defined by people especially the young people who will determine the future long after those of us who are currently in positions of power leave the stage and thats especially true in southeast asia because almost twothirds of the population in this region is under years old this is a young part of the world and ive seen the hope and the energy and the optimism of your generation wherever i travel from rangoon to jakarta to here in kl ive seen the desire for conflict resolution through diplomacy and not war ive seen the desire for prosperity through entrepreneurship not corruption or cronyism ive seen a longing for harmony not by holding down one segment of society but by upholding the rights of every human being regardless of what they look like or who they love or how they pray and so you give me hope robert kennedy once said it is a revolutionary world that we live in and thus it is young people who must take the lead and i believe it is precisely because you come of age in such world with fewer walls with instant information you have the world at your fingertips and you can change it for the better and i believe that together we can do things that your parents your grandparents your greatgrandparents would have never imagined but today i am proud that were launching a new young southeast asian leaders initiative to increase and enhance americas engagement with young people across the region youre part of this new effort youre the next generation of leaders in government in civil society in business and the arts some of you have already founded nonprofit organizations to promote human rights or prevent human trafficking or encourage religious tolerance and interfaith dialogue some of you have started projects to educate young people on the environment and engage them to protect our air and our water and to prevent climate change some of you have been building your own aseanwide network of young leaders to meet challenges like youth unemployment and i know that some of you have been spending this weekend collaborating on solutions to these major issues and over the next few months across southeast asia were going to find ways to listen to young people about your ideas and the partnerships we can then build together to empower your efforts develop new exchanges connect young leaders across southeast asia with young americans so thats part of what were starting here today and before i take your questions let me just close by sharing with you the future that i want to work for in this region about where we want americas rebalance in the asia pacific to lead about the work we can do together i believe that together we can make the asia pacific more secure america has the strongest military in the world but we dont seek conflict we seek to keep the peace we want a future where disputes are resolved peacefully and where bigger nations dont bully smaller nations all nations are equal in the eyes of international law we want to deepen our cooperation with other nations on issues like counterterrorism and piracy but also humanitarian aid and disaster relief which will help us respond quickly to catastrophes like the tsunami in japan or the typhoon in the philippines we want to do that together together we want to make the asia pacific more prosperous with more commerce and shared innovation and entrepreneurship and we want to see broader and more inclusive development and prosperity through agreements like the tpp we want to make sure nations in the asia pacific can trade under rules that ensure fair access to markets and support jobs and economic growth for everybody and set high standards for the protection of workers and the environment together we want to make the asia pacific and the world cleaner and more secure the nations of this region are uniquely threatened by climate change no nation is immune to dangerous and disruptive weather patterns so every nation is going to have to do its part and the united states is ready to do ours last year i introduced americas firstever climate action plan to use more clean energy and less dirty energy and cut the dangerous carbon pollution that contributes to climate change so we want to cooperate with countries in southeast asia to do the same to combat the destruction of our forests we cant condemn future generations to a planet that is beyond fixing we can only do that together together we can make this world more just america is the worlds oldest constitutional democracy that means were going to stand up for democracy its a part of who we are and we do this not only because we think its right but because its been proven to be the most stable and successful form of government in recent decades many asian nations have shown that different nations can realize the promise of selfgovernment in their own way they have their own path but we must recognize that democracies dont stop just with elections they also depend on strong institutions and a vibrant civil society and open political space and tolerance of people who are different than you we have to create an environment where the rights of every citizen regardless of race or gender or religion or sexual orientation are not only protected but respected we want a future where nations that are pursuing reforms like myanmar like burma consolidate their own democracy and allow for people of different faiths and ethnicities to live together in peace we want to see open space for civil society in all our countries so that citizens can hold their governments accountable and improve their own communities and we want to work together to ensure that were drawing on the potential of all our people and that means ensuring women have full and equal access to opportunity just like men applause and to make sure we can sustain all these efforts we want a future where were building an architecture of institutions and relationships for america that always begins with our alliances which serve as the cornerstone of our approach to the world but we also want to work with organizations like asean and in forums like apec and the east asia summit to resolve disputes and forge new partnerships and we want to cooperate with our old allies and our emerging partners and with china we want to see a peaceful rise for china because we think it can and should contribute to the stability and prosperity that we all seek so thats the shared future i want to see in the asia pacific now america cannot impose that future its one we need to build together in partnership with all the nations and peoples of the region especially young people that vision is within our reach if were willing to work for it now this world has its share of threats and challenges and thats usually what makes the news we know that progress can always be reversed and that positive change is achieved not through passion alone but through patient and persistent effort but weve seen things change for the better in this region and around the world because of the effort of ordinary people together working together its possible weve seen it in the opportunity and progress thats been unleashed in this amazing part of the world ive only been in malaysia for a day but ive already picked up a new phrase malaysia boleh applause malaysia can do it now i have to say we have a similar saying in america yes we can thats the spirit in which i hope america and all the nations of southeast asia can work together and its going to depend on your generation to carry it forward as presidents and prime ministers they can help lay the foundation but youve got to build the future and now i want to hear directly from you i want to hear your aspirations for your own lives your hopes for your communities and your culture what you think we can do together in the years to come terima kasih banyak applause ms woo thank you very much mr president if you may president obama well im going to take the first question and then i think anita is going to take a question from social media this is tough because we have so many outstanding young people ill call on this young lady right here right in the front tell me your name if youre going to school tell me what level youre at what year you are in school and where youre from q hi mr president im from cambodia and i went to institute of foreign languages at the royal university of phnom penh and ive got a very simple question for you what was your dream when you were in your 20s and did you achieve it and if so how did you achieve it president obama well its a short question but its not a simple one laughter when i was in high school so for those of you who are studying under a different system when i was 15 16 17 before i went to the university i wasnt always the best student sometimes i was enjoying life too much laughter dont clap laughter this guy is the same way laughter no part of it i was rebelling which is natural for young people that age i didnt know my father and so my family life was complicated so i didnt always focus on my studies and that probably carried over into the first two years of university but around the age of 20 i began to realize that i could have an impact on the world if i applied myself more i became interested in social policy and government and i decided that i wanted to work in the nonprofit sector for people who are disadvantaged in the united states and so i was able to do that for three years after i graduated from college thats how i moved to the city of chicago i was hired by a group of churches to work in poor areas to help people get jobs and help improve housing and give young people more opportunity and that was a great experience for me and it led me to go to law school and to practice civil rights laws and then ultimately to run for elected office and when i think back to my journey my past i think the most important thing for and maybe the most important thing for all the young people here is to realize that you really can have an impact on the world you can achieve your dreams but in order to do so you have to focus not so much on a title or how much money youre going to make you have to focus more on what kind of influence and impact are you going to have on other peoples lives what good can you do in the world now that may involve starting a business but if you want to start a business you should be really excited about the product or the service that youre making it shouldnt just be how much money i can make because the business people who i meet who do amazing things like bill gates who started microsoft theyre usually people who are really interested in what they do and they really think that it can make a difference in peoples lives if you want to go into government you shouldnt just want to be a particular government official you should want to go into government because you think it can help educate some children or it can help provide jobs for people who need work so i think the most important thing for me was when i started thinking more about other people and how i could have an impact in my larger society and community and wasnt just thinking about myself thats when i think your dreams can really take off because if youre only thinking about you then your world is small if youre thinking about others then your world gets bigger thank you applause ms woo thank you mr president we now have a question from the social media which weve been collecting over the week president obama okay q the question comes from our friend from burma from myanmar and he asks to mr president what would be your own key words or encouragement for each of us leaders of our next generation while we are cooperating with numerous diversities such as different races languages beliefs and cultures not only in myanmar but also across asean thank you president obama well its a great question if you look at the biggest source of conflict and war and hardship around the world one of the most if not the most important reasons is people treating those who are not like them differently so in myanmar right now theyre going through a transition after decades of repressive government theyre trying to open things up and make the country more democratic and thats a very courageous process that theyre going through but the danger now that theyre democratizing is that there are different ethnic groups and different religions inside of myanmar and if people start organizing politically around their religious identity or around their ethnic identity as opposed to organizing around principles of justice and rule of law and democracy then you can actually start seeing conflicts inside those countries that could move myanmar in a very bad direction particularly if youve got a muslim minority inside of myanmar right now that the broader population has historically looked down upon and whose rights are not fully being protected now thats not unique to myanmar here in malaysia this is a majority muslim country but then there are times where those who are nonmuslims find themselves perhaps being disadvantaged or experiencing hostility in the united states obviously historically the biggest conflicts arose around race and we had to fight a civil war and we had to have a civil rights movement over the course of generations until i could stand before you as a president of african descent applause but of course the job is not done there is still discrimination and prejudice and ethnic conflict inside the united states that we have to be vigilant against so my point is all of us have within us biases and prejudices of people who are not like us or were not raised in the same faith or come from a different ethnic background but the world is shrinking its getting smaller you could think that way when we were all living separately in villages and tribes and we didnt have contact with each other we now have the internet and smart phones and our cultures are all colliding the world has gotten smaller and no country is going to succeed if part of its population is put on the sidelines because theyre discriminated against malaysia wont succeed if nonmuslims dont have opportunity applause myanmar wont succeed if the muslim population is oppressed no society is going to succeed if half your population meaning women arent getting the same education and employment opportunities as men applause so i think the key point for all of you especially as young people is you should embrace your culture you should be proud of who you are and your background and you should appreciate the differences in language and food and how you worship god is going to be different and those are things that you should be proud of but it shouldnt be a tool to look down on somebody else it shouldnt be a reason to discriminate and you have to make sure that you are speaking out against that in your daily life and as you emerge as leaders you should be on the side of politics that brings people together rather than drives them apart applause that is the most important thing for this generation and part of the way to do that is to be able to stand in other peoples shoes see through their eyes almost every religion has within it the basic principle that i as a christian understand from the teachings of jesus do unto others as you would have them do unto you treat people the way you want to be treated and if youre not doing that and if society is not respecting that basic principle then were going backwards instead of going forward and this is true all around the world and sometimes its among groups that those of us on the outside we look they look exactly the same in northern ireland there has been a raging conflict although they have finally come to arrive at peace because half or a portion of the population is catholic a portion is protestant from the outside you look why are they arguing theyre both irish they speak the same language it seems as if theyd have nothing to argue about but thats been a part of ireland that has been held back and is poor and less developed than the part of ireland that didnt have that conflict in africa you go to countries my fathers country of kenya where oftentimes youve seen tribal conflicts from the outside youd think what are they arguing about this is a country that has huge potential they should be growing but instead they spend all their time arguing and organizing politically only around tribe and around ethnicity and then when one gets on top theyre suspicious and theyre worried that the other might take advantage of them and when power shifts then its payback and we see that in society after society the most important thing young people can do is break out of that mindset when i was in korea i had a chance to or in tokyo rather i had a chance to see an exhibit with an astronaut a japanese astronaut who was at the international space station and it was looking at the entire globe and theyre tracking now changing weather patterns in part because it gives us the ability to respond to disasters quicker and when you see astronauts from japan or from the united states or from russia or others working together and theyre looking down at this planet from a distance you realize were all on this little rock in the middle of space and the differences that seem so important to us from a distance dissolve into nothing and so we have to have that same perspective respecting everybody treating everybody equally under the law that has to be a principle that all of you uphold great question applause let me call on the im going to go boy girl boy girl so that everybody gets a fair chance lets see hold on this gentleman right here right there with the glasses applause there you go q hello mr president president obama hello q im from malaysia currently with yes alumni malaysia well i have a question i wondered what was your first project community service project that you didnt like and how did the project impact your community thank you so much president obama thats a great question applause i told you that when i graduated from college i wanted to work in poor neighborhoods and so i moved to chicago and i worked this community had gone through some very difficult times the steel plants there the steel mills had closed a lot of manufacturing was moving out of america or becoming technologically obsolete these old mills and so these were areas that had been entirely dependent on steel and as those jobs left the communities were being abandoned and there was also racial change in the area they had been predominantly white and then blacks and latinos had moved in and there was fear among the various groups so they had a lot of problems i will tell you this what i did was i organized a series of meetings listening to people to find out what they wanted to do something about first the most immediate problem they saw was there was a lot of crime that had emerged in the area but they didnt quite know how to do anything about it so i organized a meeting with the police commander so that they could file their complaints directly to the police commander and try to get more action to create more safe space in those communities for children and to end people standing on street corners because it was depressing the whole community now heres the main thing i want to tell you that first meeting nobody came it was a complete failure and i was very depressed because i thought well everybody said that they were concerned about crime but when i organized the meeting nobody came and what it made me realize is is that if you want to bring about change in a community or in a nation its not going to happen overnight usually its very hard to bring about change because people are busy in their daily lives they have things to do one of the things i realized was i hadnt organized the meeting at the right time it was right around dinner time and if people were working they were coming home and picking up their kids and they couldnt get to the meeting fast enough so first of all youve got to try to get people involved and a lot of people are busy in their own lives or they dont think its going to make a difference or theyre scared if theyre speaking out against authority and many of the problems that were facing like trying to create jobs or better opportunity or dealing with poverty or dealing with the environment these are problems that have been going on for decades and so to think that somehow youre going to change it in a day or a week and then if it doesnt happen you just give up well then you definitely wont succeed so the most important thing that i learned as a young person trying to bring about change is you have to be persistent and you have to get more people involved and you have to form relationships with different groups and different organizations and you have to listen to people about what theyre feeling and what theyre concerned about and build trust and then you have to try to find a small part of the problem and get success on that first so that maybe from there you can start something else and make it bigger and make it bigger until over time you are really making a difference in your community and in that problem but you cant be impatient and the great thing about young people is theyre impatient the biggest problem with young people is theyre impatient its a strength because its what makes you want to change things but sometimes you can be disappointed if change doesnt happen right away and then you just give up and you just have to stay with it and learn from your failures as well as your successes anita ms woo mr president thank you very much we have a question from our friend in singapore he asks what is the legacy you wish to leave behind president obama ive still got two and a half years left as president so i hope hes not rushing me laughter but what is true is that as president of the united states you have so many issues coming at you every day but sometimes i try to step back and think about years from now when i look back what will i be most proud of or what do i think will be most important in the work that ive done now my most important legacy is malia and sasha who are turning out to be wonderful young people applause so your children if youre a parent the most important legacy you have is great children and i have those who are happy and healthy and i think theyre going to do great things another important legacy is being a good husband so ive tried to do that applause thats important because if you dont do those things well then everything else youre going to have some problems with laughter but i think as president what ive tried to do in the united states is really focus on how do you create opportunity for all people and when i first came into office we were in a huge financial crisis that had hit the entire world and it was the worst crisis the united states had had since the 1930s so the first thing i had to do was just make sure that we stop the crisis and start allowing the economy to recover and weve now created more than million jobs and the economy is beginning to improve for a lot of people but what youve also seen is a trend in the united states but also around the world in which even when the economy grows it tends to benefit a lot of people at the very top but the vast majority of people they dont benefit as much and youre starting to see bigger and bigger gaps in inequality and in wealth and in opportunity and thats true not just in the united states its true in europe its long been true in parts of asia its been true in latin america and i believe that economies work best when growth and development is broadbased when its shared when ordinary people if they work hard and they take responsibility they can succeed not everybody is going to be rich but everybody should be able to live a good life not everybody is going to be a billionaire but everybody should be able to have a nice home and educate their children and feel some sense of security so thats not something that i can do by myself as president of the united states but everything that i do whether its providing more help for people to go to college or giving early childhood education to young children because we know that the younger children get some additional schooling especially poor children the better off theyll do in school for all the years to come to the work that were trying to do in providing health care for all americans so that they dont experience a crisis when somebody in their family gets sick all of those efforts are with the objective of making sure that ordinary people if they work hard and act responsibly they can succeed and internationally my main goal has been to work with other partners to promote a system of rules so that conflicts can be resolved peacefully so that nations observe basic rules of behavior so that whether youre a big country or a small country you know that there are certain principles that are observed that might doesnt just make right but that theres a set of ideals and theres justice both inside countries and between countries now that means trying to end the proliferation of nuclear weapons which are a threat to humanity and weve made progress in that front me negotiating the reduction of our nuclear stockpiles with the russians and trying to resolve through diplomacy the problem that iran has been trying to pursue nuclear weapons and working with countries like malaysia to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons that means working to get chemical weapons out of syria it means trying to promote a just peace between the israelis and the palestinians it means opening up to burma and i was the first president to visit there and seeing if we could take advantage of the opportunity with aung san suu kyis release to create a country that was a responsible part of the world order sometimes our efforts have been successful sometimes as i told this young man here my efforts initially havent been as successful and ive had to keep on trying and i am confident that when im done as president theres still going to be parts of the world that are having war that are having conflict that are oppressing their own people so im not going to solve all these problems ive got to leave some work for all of you laughter but what i do hope is that i will have made progress on each of those fronts that if when i leave i can say there are a few more countries that are democracies now and the united states helped if there are countries where i can say or areas of the world where i can say we avoided conflict between two countries because we helped to mediate a dispute ill be proud of that if there are countries where a spotlight has been shined internationally on the oppression of a minority group and it has forced that country to change its practices that will be a success i dont consider i dont think i can do that by myself of course i can only do that not only with the cooperation and consultation of other leaders but its also other citizens of the world all of you and people in various regions theyve got to want more justice and more peace in order for us to achieve it sometimes the united states is viewed as on the one hand the cause of everybodys problem or on the other hand the united states is expected to solve everybodys problem and we are a big powerful nation and we take our responsibilities very seriously but we can only do so much ultimately the people in these countries themselves have to partner with us because we have problems in our own country that we have to solve but hopefully im also lifting up certain universal principles and ideals that all of us can embrace and share all right its a womans turn its a young womans turn ive got to lets see who is back here no its a young ladys turn okay this young lady right here since the microphone is right there q good afternoon mr president and welcome to malaysia gathering from what youve said i think its a shared consensus that youth worldwide can be the catalyst planting the seeds for an early conditioning on certain global issues here so my question is how exactly can america lead us youth internationally in championing such issues for example climate change women empowerment poverty eradication the goal being to bring the human race together it appears that a lot of policies have been put in place but a lot of the policies that have been put in place by the gen xers the baby boomers people like us the gen ys we dont have a say in this policy so we are supposed to champion them but how are we supposed to do all these things president obama im trying to figure out which generation i am laughter you got baby boomers then gen x and then theres a gen y were on y is that z are they here yet or thats next well first of all just to be very specific as i said in my speech part of the reason that i like to meet with young people is to get their suggestions and their ideas but then what we try to do is set up a process and a network of young leaders who can share ideas with each other and with us to let us know how they think we can empower you so coming out of this meeting there will be mechanisms through social media and in our embassies in each of the asean countries where were going to be bringing together youth leaders to talk to each other about their plans what their priorities are how they think the united states can be most helpful and were going to take your suggestions and lets take the example of something like climate change the voice of young people on this issue is so important because you are the ones who are going to have to deal with the consequences of this most significantly i rode with prime minister najib from our press conference to the new magic center thats been set up entrepreneurial center that came out of our global entrepreneur summit that was hosted here in malaysia and on the ride over it hadnt started raining yet but you could tell it was going to be raining soon and he said that here in malaysia youve already seen a change in weather patterns it used to be that the dry season and the rainy season was very clear now it all just kind of is blurring together now not all of that can be directly attributed precisely to climate change but when you look at whats been happening all across the country or all around the world theres no doubt that weather patterns are changing it is getting warmer that is going to have impacts in terms of more flooding more drought displacement it could affect food supplies it could affect the incidences of diseases coastal communities could be severely affected and what happens when humans are placed under stress is the likelihood of conflict increases there is a theory that one of the things that happened in syria to trigger the protests that resulted in the terrible violent efforts to suppress them by president assad was repeated drought in syria that drove people off their land so they could no longer afford to make the traditional living that they had made now whether thats true or not we dont know precisely but what we do know is that you see in communities that are under severe weather pressure drought famine food prices increasing theyre more likely to be in conflict and youre going to have to deal with this unless we do something about it so the question is what can we do every country should be coming up with a climate action plan to try to reduce its carbon emissions in southeast asia one of the most important issues is deforestation in indonesia and malaysia what youve seen is huge portions of tropical forests that actually use carbon and so reduce the effects of climate change reduce carbon being released into the atmosphere and warming the planet theyre just being shredded because of primarily the palm oil industry and there are large business interests behind that industry now the question is are we going to in each of those countries say how can we help preserve these forests while using a different approach to economic development that does less to damage the atmosphere and that means engaging then with the various stakeholders youve got to talk to the businesses involved youve got to talk to the government the communities who may be getting jobs because their first priority is feeding themselves so if you just say weve got to stop cutting down the forests but you dont have an alternative opportunity for people then they may just ignore you so there are going to be all kinds of pieces just to that one part of the problem and each country may have a different element to it the point though is that you have to be part of the solution not part of the problem you have to say this is important you dont have to be a climate science expert but you can educate yourselves on the issue you can discuss it with your peer groups you can organize young people to interact with international organizations that are already dealing with this issue you can help to publicize it you can educate your parents friends coworkers and through that process you can potentially change policy so it may take it will take years it will not happen next week but our hope is that through this network that were going to be developing that we can be a partner with you in that process so i just want to check how many how much time do we have here who is in charge ms woo weve got time mr president president obama how much time ms woo a couple more questions president obama a couple more questions all right because i just want to make sure that im being fair here all right its a guys turn lets see all right how about this guy because i like his hair cut the guy with the spiky hair right there applause q in your opinion what are the top three advice to fellow malaysians and government to become a developed country in six years time as this is one of countrys missions and i think its important for fellow malaysians to contribute together in order to achieve that thank you applause president obama well i had an extensive conversation with prime minister najib about his development strategy first of all malaysia is now a middleincome country its done much better than many other countries in per capita income and growth over the last two decades and theres been some wise leadership that has helped to promote malaysian exports and to help to train its people youve got high literacy rates which is critically important investing in people is the single most important thing in the knowledge economy traditionally wealth was defined by land and natural resources today the most important resources is between our ears and malaysia has made a good investment in young people so that continues to be i think the most important strategy for growth in the 21st century and in the united states my main focus is improving our education system and lifelong learning because part of whats changed in the economy in the 20th century you got a change at a company you might stay there for years things didnt change that much now you may be at one company and that company may be absorbed and you might have to retrain for a new job because the thing that you were doing before has been made obsolete because of technology so we have to keep on investing in not only elementary school and secondary school and even universities but in the united states for example we have a system of community colleges and job training where somebody whos in their 30s or even 40s or 50s can go back get retrained get more skills adapt to a new industry and then be a productive citizen thats a critical investment that needs to be made the second thing that i know prime minister najib is focused on and this applies throughout the region is if you want to move to the next level of development then you have to open up an economy to innovation and entrepreneurship the initial push for growth in southeast asia initially started with exporting raw materials and then shifted to manufacturing and light assembly and being part of the global supply chain and thats all a very important ladder into development but now a lot of wealth is being created by new products and new ideas and at least in the united states for example we dont want to just assemble the latest smartphone we want to invent the latest smartphone we want to invent the apps and the content for those smartphones and then we have an asset that whoever is manufacturing it some of the value is still flowing to us well what that requires then is changes in the economy to make it more open to make it more entrepreneurial some of the old systems have to be broken down now different countries in asean and different countries around the world are at different stages of development in some countries the most important thing for development is just basic rule of law and something that i said earlier which is making sure that the law applies to everybody in the same way i believe if malaysia is going to take that next leap then its going to have to make sure that the economy is one where everybody has the opportunity regardless of where they started to succeed applause and that energy has to be unleashed and i think prime minister najib understands that and the trade agreement that were trying to create the tpp part of what were trying to do is to create higher standards for labor protection higher standards for environmental protection more consistent protection of intellectual property because increasingly thats the next phase of wealth all those things require more transparency and more accountability and more rule of law and i think that its entirely consistent with malaysia moving into the next phase now its hard to change old ways of doing things and thats true for every country i mean china right now after unprecedented growth over the last years realizes its got to change its whole strategy its been so exportoriented but now theyre starting to realize that if they want to continue to grow theyve got to develop consumer markets inside their own country and what that means is is that theyve got to give workers more ability to spend on consumer goods and that they have to have a social safety net so that workers arent just saving all the time because if they get sick they dont have any social insurance programs and they dont have any retirement groups and so theyre starting to make these shifts but these are hard shifts even in a country thats controlled by the central party thats not democratic its because certain people have gotten accustomed to and done very well with an exportdriven strategy so when you shift theres going to be somebody who resists thats true in every country its true in the united states weve got to change how we do things and when you try to change somebody somewhere is benefiting from the status quo malaysia is no different but im confident that you can make it happen ill take two more questions and its a young ladys turn so guys you can all put down your hands laughter lets see this young lady with the yellow q good morning im from indonesia president obama apa kabar q baikbaik saja president obama baik q well okay i have a very short question what does happiness mean for you president obama what does happiness mean to me q yes president obama wow you guys thats a big philosophical question applause i mentioned earlier my family and it really is true that the older i get the more when i think about when im on my deathbed i mean i dont think about this all the time laughter i dont want you to think im still fairly young but when i think at the end of my life and im looking back what will have been most important to me i think its the time i will have spent with the people i love and so that makes me happy but i also think that as i get older whats most important to me is feeling as if ive been true to my beliefs and that ive lived with some integrity now that doesnt always make you happy in the sense of youre laughing just enjoying life because sometimes being true to your beliefs is uncomfortable sometimes doing things that you think are right may put you in some conflict with somebody sometimes people may not appreciate it and it may be inconvenient but i think that part of being satisfied at least with life as you get older is feeling as if you know that every day you wake up and theres certain things you believe in for example respecting other people or showing kindness to others or trying to promote justice or whatever it is that you think is best in you that at the end of each day you can say okay you know what i was consistent with what i say im about what i say i believe in the image i have of myself and when im uncomfortable is when i think you know i didnt do my best today maybe i didnt speak out when i should have spoken out maybe i didnt work as hard on this issue as i should have worked then im tossing and turning and i dont feel good and i think that having that kind of integrity is important where you can look at yourself in the mirror and you can say okay i am who i want who i say i want to be and nobody is perfect and everybody is going to make mistakes but i think if you feel as if youre always striving towards your ideals then youll feel okay at the end okay last question and its lets see no no its a guys question women put down your hands laughter okay ill call on this gentleman here because he there you go with the glasses q good evening mr president obama im from malaysia im an undergrad from university of malaya so my question is in your position right now what values that you uphold the most that you think is very important that makes you what you are today and what do you wish to bring that value to the young people of today that can change the world to become a better world thank you president obama well thank you im going to take another question after that because ive already answered this question wait wait wait let me laughter let me explain the what i think is most important is showing people respect who you disagree with right applause and so for example theres a note over there i dont know what those young people are putting a note about but i think that the basic idea that if somebody is not like you if they look differently than you if they believe differently than you that you are treating them as you want to be treated if you are applying those ideas i think youre going to be halfway there in terms of solving most of the worlds problems and a lot of that is around some of the traditional divisions that we have in our society race ethnicity religion gender treat people with respect whoever they are and expect your governments to treat everybody with respect applause and if you do that then youre going to be okay all right last question young ladies wait wait wait everybody put down their hands for a second okay now ive heard from ive had an indonesian a malaysian a cambodian myanmar thailand didnt get called on so i think all right thailand where okay and the philippines well see i cant call on everybody laughter thailand said they were the first ones to shout go ahead this young lady right here q hi president very short question what are the things that you regret now that you have done in the past president obama what are the things that i regret oh the list is so long laughter i regret calling on you because now im going to be telling everybody my business laughter no im just joking about that laughter im now and i still feel pretty good im a little grayhaired but i will tell you two things i regret one is very specific one is more general the specific thing is i regret not having spent more time with my mother because she died early she got cancer right around when she was my age actually she was just a year older than i am now she died it happened very fast in about six months and i realized that there was a stretch of time from when i was lets say until i was where i was so busy with my own life that i didnt always reach out and communicate with her and ask her how she was doing and tell her about things i was nice and id call and write once in a while but this goes to what i was saying earlier about what you remember in the end i think is the people you love i realized that i didnt every single day or at least more often just spend time with her and find out what she was thinking and what she was doing because she had been such an important part of my life now thats natural as young people as you grow up you become independent but for those of you who have not called their parents lately i would just say that that is something actually that i regret the more general answer is i regret wasting time i think when i was young i spent a lot of time on things that i realize now were not very important and i wish i had used my time more wisely now i dont want people to spend every minute of every day working all the time because you have to enjoy life and you have to have friends and you have to appreciate all that life has to offer but i do think that in america at least but now i think worldwide we spend an awful lot of time on diversions watching tv or playing video games and all that time when you add it all up i say to myself i could have spent more time learning a foreign language or i could have spent more time working on a project that was important and i think it would be useful for all of you to consider how youre spending your time and make sure that youre making every day count let me just say this by way of thank you to all of you i think youve asked terrific questions im so impressed with all of you and what you have done and what youll do in the future i do want you to feel optimistic about your future even though i told you about some problems like climate change that seem so big now i always say we get white house interns to come in and they work at the white house and theyre there for six months and then i usually speak to them at the end of six months and i always tell them that despite how hard sometimes the world seems to be and all you see on television is war and conflict and poverty and violence the truth is that if you had to choose when to be born not knowing where or who you would be in all of human history now would be the time because the world is less violent it is healthier it is wealthier it is more tolerant and it offers more opportunity than any time in human history for more people than any time in human history now that doesnt mean that there arent still terrible things happening around the world or in this region we still have things like human trafficking and we still have terrible abuse of children and there are conflicts and so these are things that were going to have to tackle and deal with but you should know that with each successive generation things have improved just a little bit and over time that little bit adds to a lot and its now up to you the next generation to make sure that years from now or years from now people look back and say wow things are a lot better now than they were back then and there will still be problems or years from now also but they will be different problems because you will have solved many of the problems that exist today and america wants to be a partner with you in that process so good luck thank you everybody applause ms woo thank you very much mr president its been a wonderful opportunity and we appreciate it very much president obama thank you everybody applause
